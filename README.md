# UnityFeesEstimatorTool

This tool estimates the potential fees you might incur as a result of Unity's new license Fees.

The tool can be viewed [here](https://www.tjclifton.net/unity-fees-estimator-tool).

There are 2 modes available for the tool.

## Simple
This mode displays the fees Unity will charge, given your license type, total number of installs and gross revenue.

## Free to Play Costs
The changes that Unity have made are arguably most concerning for developers of free to play games. This mode attempts to
provide some more detailed breakdowns of how and when the costs will be applied.

> Note: These numbers are just estimates, real usagee will vary. In particular, the Free to Play estimator assumes that the
> average revenue per install will be gained in the same month as the install itself. However, unless your retention curve is incredibly
> short this is unlikely to be the case. With a consistent number of users over time we can probably use this as a rough guesstimate of earnings
> for the month but when your game is ramping up with installs and (hopefully) improving retention, the actual revenue will lag behind which means
> the fees will probably kick in a bit later than suggested.
